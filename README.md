Vaccination Data Analysis & Visualization
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing vaccination data using Python (Jupyter Notebook) and visualizing key insights with Power BI.
The workflow involves:

Cleaning and preparing vaccination datasets

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualizing patterns and trends in vaccination rates

Building an interactive Power BI dashboard for decision-making

Tools & Technologies

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas, NumPy â†’ Data cleaning & transformation

Matplotlib, Seaborn â†’ Visualization

Power BI

Interactive dashboard & data storytelling

GitHub â†’ Version control & portfolio showcase
